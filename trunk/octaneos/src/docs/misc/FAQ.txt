What is inline?
-------------
The point of making a function "inline" is to hint to 
the compiler that it is worth making some form of 
extra effort to call the function faster than it 
would otherwise - generally by substituting the code of the function into its caller

When is do_floppy used?
-----------------------
	see setup_rw_floppy,
	Does the following
	do_floppy = rw_interrupt;

What about all the interrupt method swapping?
