Bots/Agents could change the IT infrastructure, but to my knowledge
there aren't any powerful simple open-source solutions.

And I am not saying that this bot will do anything more than waste space on
your hard-drive, but take a minute to imagine, hundreds of bots on your
network doing simple tasks, interacting between themselves and actual people.

I went with LISP, because lisp has been used in AI for decades.  It is a simple
layer on top of the actual application.  The only problem with lisp is that
it is still not a 'smart' language.  Any thing that enables your bot to solve
problems on its own has to be written.
